                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Procrastination is the action of delaying or postponing something.
                    The word has origin from the Latin procrastinatus, which itself evolved from the prefix pro-,
                    meaning "forward," and crastinus, meaning "of tomorrow." [1] It could be further stated as a
                    habitual or intentional delay of starting or finishing a task despite knowing it might have negative
                    consequences.[2] It is a common human experience involving delay in everyday chores or even putting
                    off salient tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment,
                    or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. Although typically perceived as a negative trait due
                    to its hindering effect on one's productivity often associated with depression, low self-esteem,
                    guilt and inadequacy,[3] it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could
                    present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.[4]

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body,
                    characterized by
                    altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition
                    of
                    nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,[1] and reduced interactions with
                    surroundings.[2] It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli,
                    but
                    more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying very different and
                    active
                    brain patterns.
                    Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM
                    sleep
                    and non-REM sleep. Although REM stands for "rapid eye movement", this mode of sleep has many other
                    aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. A well-known feature of sleep is the dream, an
                    experience typically recounted in narrative form, which resembles waking life while in progress, but

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> Artificial intelligence (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by
                    machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks
                    define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and
                    takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially, the
                    term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic
                    "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem
                    solving".[4]

                    As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often
                    removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[5] A quip in Tesler's
                    Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."[6] For instance, optical character recognition
                    is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[7] having become a routine technology.[8]
